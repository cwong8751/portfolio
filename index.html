            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Carl, welcome to my portfolio.</p>

            <p>I am currently a third year studying Computer Science @ WashU. My interests involve riding and maintaining my motorcycle, and writing computer programs. </p>

            <h3>Stories</h3>
            <i>Home was never the same after I left, and the life I now lead feels too familiar to truly be called home. I understand this is the journey my ancestors once took—three generations before me, they left their hometowns in pursuit of something better, never to return. In this moment, I believe it was destiny. But I wonder—did my father, forty years ago, regret his decision? No matter how much one may hate their circumstances, life pushes forward. The path of retreat vanished the moment the ticket was bought, the moment the door closed behind him, leaving the brave traveler alone to face the winds. My dear madam, I agree with you: as time moves on, life charts its own course, following the grand winds that shape our struggles. Yet the truest and most profound desire of any seafarer, traveler, or explorer is not to return home with wealth or success, but to return at all. Home ceased to exist the moment we embarked on this great escape, leaving us like kites with broken strings—forever drifting, unanchored.</i>
            <Br>
            <i>The throttle is like a baton, passed from one generation to the next, a sacred trust held deep within our hearts. We all knew that some might not return. The task shifts, and now the weight of the future rests on our shoulders.

                Watching my father ride was a revelation—every move a dance of precision. The goods secured in the back seat were a testament to his skill.
                
                “Is it heavy, Dad?” I would ask, wide-eyed.
                
                “No, not at all, son.”
                
                But when I took the bars, I discovered the truth. The five saddle bags of supplies felt heavy. The two boxes of tools were burdensome. Having Mum and my younger brother as pillions added weight. Every ride now carried the weight of unconfessed feelings for the girl I left behind and the rush to console a friend in despair.
                
                Each mile felt heavy with responsibility—the dreams of my family resting on my shoulders, the fear of loss trailing behind me. 
                
                “Is it heavy?” I asked again, my heart racing.
                
                “No, not at all.” 
                
                In those words, I realized the bike is more than a machine; it’s a vessel of responsibility. As I ride, I accept this weight and forge ahead—because even when it feels overwhelming, we keep moving forward.</i>
