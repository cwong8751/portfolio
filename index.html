            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Carl, welcome to my portfolio.</p>

            <p>I am currently a third year studying Computer Science @ WashU. My interests involve riding and maintaining my motorcycle, and writing computer programs. </p>


            <i>Home was never the same after I left, and the life I now lead feels too familiar to truly be called home. I understand this is the journey my ancestors once took—three generations before me, they left their hometowns in pursuit of something better, never to return. In this moment, I believe it was destiny. But I wonder—did my father, forty years ago, regret his decision? No matter how much one may hate their circumstances, life pushes forward. The path of retreat vanished the moment the ticket was bought, the moment the door closed behind him, leaving the brave traveler alone to face the winds. My dear madam, I agree with you: as time moves on, life charts its own course, following the grand winds that shape our struggles. Yet the truest and most profound desire of any seafarer, traveler, or explorer is not to return home with wealth or success, but to return at all. Home ceased to exist the moment we embarked on this great escape, leaving us like kites with broken strings—forever drifting, unanchored.</i>
