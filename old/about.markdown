My name is Carl, I am from the province of Canton, PRC. In my free time, I like to ride and work on motorcycles, as well as write computer programs. I am interested in web and mobile development, as well as machine learning techniques like object identification and text recognition.

I believe, computers should serve humanity, therefore, computer programs should be designed with humans in mind. In a world where computers are so frequently used, we should think about the human.
