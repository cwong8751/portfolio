            <h3>living</h3>
            <p>here are a few places for you to live off campus while not burning a whole through your wallet. </p>
            <b>Delmar loop area</b>
            <p>Anything that's behind United Provisions and Lofts is somewhat affordable. Enright, Cates, Interdrive. Avg unit prices 3b2b is 1900. If you get 2 other roommates your average rent is around 600$/month.</p>
            <b>Loop North</b>
            <p>This is further than the Enright area, but still covered by Line 5 and two shuttle lines. Avg rent around 1600, more 2b2b units and single units. If you do a 2b2b and split with another person, you get around 800$/month. Most units come with parking, sewer, trash.</p>
            <b>Skinker-Debalievere</b>
            <p>Honestly I don't know much about this place but people say its affordable, pricing is similiar to delmar loop but there are more robberies. also closer to campus.</p>
            <b>Area behind Lewis park and in front of Olive</b>
            <p>Good area, far from everything, but is alot cheaper, around 1500-1700 for a 2b2b. Sometimes you can even get close to 1k for a apartment. Is near the U City High School.</p>
